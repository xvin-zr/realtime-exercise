# Intro to Real-Time

A funny real-time chat app by [Brian Holt](https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-realtime/).

## Polling

For the frontend, run:

```
npx vite
```

And for the backend, run:

```
node server.js
```

## HTTP/2

Go to `/http2`, check and run 2 commands in `backend/server.js`.
Then run:

```
node backend/server.js
```

## WebSocket

For both `raw/` and `socketio/`, run:

```
npx tsx backend/server.ts
```

Finally, start chatting using your preferred protocol. 🎙️
